/* Question_1
-- The club is adding a new facility - a spa. 
-- We need to add it into the facilities table. Use the following values:
-- facid: 9, Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800. */




/* Question_2
In the previous exercise, you learned how to add a facility. 
Now you're going to add multiple facilities in one command. Use the following values:

facid: 9, Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800.
facid: 10, Name: 'Squash Court 2', membercost: 3.5, guestcost: 17.5, initialoutlay: 5000, monthlymaintenance: 80. */




/* Question_3
Let's try adding the spa to the facilities table again. 
This time, though, we want to automatically generate the value for the next facid, 
rather than specifying it as a constant. Use the following values for everything else:

Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800. */



/* Question_4
We made a mistake when entering the data for the second tennis court. 
The initial outlay was 10000 rather than 8000: you need to alter the data to fix the error. */



/* Question_5
We want to increase the price of the tennis courts for both members and guests. 
Update the costs to be 6 for members, and 30 for guests. */



/* Question_6
We want to alter the price of the second tennis court so that it costs 10% more than the first one. 
Try to do this without using constant values for the prices, so that we can reuse the statement if we want to. */




/* Question_7
As part of a clearout of our database, we want to delete all bookings from the cd.bookings table. 
How can we accomplish this? */




/* Question_8
We want to remove member 37, who has never made a booking, from our database. 
How can we achieve that? */




/* Question_9
In our previous exercises, we deleted a specific member who had never made a booking. 
How can we make that more general, to delete all members who have never made a booking? */
